Find the bug(s) and modify one line of code in the incorrect implementation of a function solution that is supposed to return the smallest element of the given non-empty array A which contains at most 1000 integers within range [-1000..1000]. Notice that for the example test case A [-1, 1, -2, 2] the attached code is already returning the correct answer (-2).
