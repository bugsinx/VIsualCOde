You are given a string S. Deletion of the K-th letter of S costs C[K]. After deleting a letter, the costs of deleting other letters do not change. For example, for S = "ab" and C = [1, 3], after deleting 'a', deletion of "b' will still cost 3. 

You want to delete some letters from S to obtain a string without two identical letters next to each other. What is the minimum total cost of deletions to achieve such a string? 

Write a function: 
    function solution($S,$C);
    
that, given string S and array C of integers, both of length N, returns the minimum cost of all necessary deletions.

Examples:

1. Given S = "abccbd" and C = [0,1,2,3,4,5], the function should return 2. You can delete the first occurrence of 'c' to achieve "abcbd".

2. Given S = "aabbcc" and C = [1,2,1,2,1,2], the function should return 3. By deleting all letters with a cost of 1, you can achieve string "abc".

3. Given S = "aaaa" and C = [3,4,5,6], the function should return 12. You need to delete all but one letter 'a', and the lowest cost of deletions is 3+4+5=12.

4. Given S = "ababa" and C = [10,5,10,5,10], the function should return 0. There is no need to delete any letter.

Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:
     
    * String S and array C have length equal to N;
    * N is an integer with range [1..100,000];
    * string S is made only of lowercase letters (a-z);
    * each element of array C is an integer within the range [0..1,000].
